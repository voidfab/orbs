/**
 * The figure *unbaked*, with the pose left as numbers, for a renderer that has
 * to morph between two poses itself.
 *
 * The sibling of `_marks` rather than a mode on it, and the split is the point.
 * `_marks` welds the pose into the geometry, which is exactly right for drawing
 * one pose and exactly wrong for travelling between two: a morph that re-bakes
 * regenerates every eye path per frame. So this returns the figure as it was
 * drawn, before any pose touched it, and hands the pose back as the thirteen
 * channels `poseTransforms` turns into one transform per eye. What changes
 * during a morph is those strings and nothing else.
 *
 * Static consumers pay nothing for it. They keep calling `_marks`, whose shape
 * and cost are untouched, and this whole function tree-shakes out of a bundle
 * that never mentions it, which a mode with a branch inside `_marks` could not
 * have offered.
 *
 * ## What comes back
 *
 * `marks` and `eyes` are the same list `_marks` returns, split in two, because
 * the eyes are the only marks a pose moves and each needs a group of its own.
 * They are already in draw order: everything in `marks`, then everything in
 * `eyes`, which is where `marks()` puts them.
 *
 * `eyeFrames` is what `poseTransforms` needs, and it is deliberately the *drawn*
 * centres and lean rather than anything posed: the transforms are built against
 * the geometry as emitted, so a caller cannot accidentally compose a pose onto a
 * figure that already wears one.
 *
 * `fill` and `hot` are the two ends of the colour travel. `hot` is `null` on
 * every pose that does not tint, which is most of them, and it is a finished
 * colour rather than a target, the mix at the pose's own `heat`, so a morph
 * fades between two hex values exactly as `transition: fill` does on the web.
 * See `fadeHex`.
 *
 * `pose` is `undefined` for no expression, which `lerpPose` reads as idle.
 *
 * `expr` is the `.mo-expr` predicate, computed here rather than by the caller
 * because there is already a copy of it in `motion` above and two would drift.
 * It answers "is the blobatar wearing an expression at all", which is what
 * picks the morph's clock: adopting one is quick and returning to idle is
 * slower, and a renderer with no stylesheet has to make that choice itself. It
 * goes through `e.vars` for the same reason `motion` does, since an expression
 * that moves nothing *is* idle and a tint alone is enough to be non-idle.
 *
 * Underscored on the same terms as `_marks`, `_parts` and `_layout`.
