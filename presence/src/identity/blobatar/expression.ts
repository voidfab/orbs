/**
 * Expressions — `blobatar/expression`. See docs/expression-spec.md.
 *
 * An expression is a named pose the consumer sets and the library holds. It is
 * a separate axis from the idle loop in `animate.ts`: idle motion is ambient and
 * gated on hover, an expression is triggered and gated on nothing. A blobatar can
 * be sad and still breathing.
 *
 * Pose-only, by definition — every channel below moves a part the blobatar already
 * has. Nothing here adds a mark, so a `blob` grows no mouth when it is happy.
 * That ceiling is what the roster has to live inside: two capsule eyes and a
 * soft body, with no brows to carry anger the easy way.
 *
 * **Each expression is passed in, not named.** `blobatar()` never imports this
 * module; it calls through whatever object it is handed, so a consumer who
 * imports `happy` ships `happy` and one who imports nothing ships nothing. That
 * is the same indirection keeping `animate.ts` out of static bundles, and it is
 * here for the same reason: as a plain string option, expressions charged every
 * caller ~420 B for a feature most will never use.
 *
 * It is also why the exports below are plain object literals over shared
 * function references rather than calls to a `make()` factory. A top-level
 * function call is not provably side-effect-free, so every expression would
 * survive tree-shaking whether or not it was imported — the same trap already
 * documented on `_parts` in `blobatar.ts`.

 * The nearest neighbour is `unsure`, not `sleepy` — the two asymmetric faces —
 * and the §2 rule clears on four channels: `edy2` (−2.6 against 0), `rock` (0.7
 * against 0), `esy` (0.50 against 1.02) and `esx2` (0.02 against 0.24). The
 * sentences differ too, which is the part the table cannot show: `unsure` is
 * eyes of mismatched *size*, this is eyes at mismatched *height*, and mismatched
 * height is the only one of the two that has anywhere to go.
 *
 * `edy` is positive on a pose that reads as lifted, and that is not a typo. The
 * pair's mean sits at `edy + edy2/2` — +1.0 and −1.3 — so the eyes straddle the
 * idle line 0.3 units high with the stagger hung across it, rather than the
 * whole pair riding low and the right eye alone reaching up.
