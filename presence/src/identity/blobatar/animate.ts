 * them would be two crowds moving differently. `motionVars` is now a
 * serializer over this, and `src/idle.ts` evaluates the loops from it directly.
 *
 * **Phases are positive here and negated on the way out.** A CSS
 * `animation-delay` has to be negative to offset a phase rather than postpone a
 * start, which is a property of that property and not of the number: a loop
 * evaluated in JavaScript wants "how far into the cycle this blobatar begins",
 * which is what this says. The negation stays where the quirk is.
 *
 * Magnitude and sign of the look vector are drawn separately for the reason
 * `motionVars` gives, and both survive here: the foreshortening layer needs
 * *how far* the eyes travel, which is sign-independent.

 * and they are the single most load-bearing 40 bytes in the motion layer.
 *
 * Delays are negated **here**, at the source. A positive `animation-delay`
 * postpones the start rather than offsetting the phase, so the whole grid would
 * still open in unison — after an awkward pause. Same keystroke, opposite
 * behavior, and it only shows on first paint.
 *
 * Breathe and bob get independent offsets. Sharing one preserves the drift
 * between their two periods but locks every blobatar into the *same* drift, which
 * is the unison problem again, one level up.
 *
 * These keys cost nothing in compatibility: traits are string-addressed, so
 * adding `motion.*` cannot perturb any existing blobatar.
