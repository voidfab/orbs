 * an XML parser between the renderer and the screen, which is a place output
 * can change, and ADR-0009 is explicit that an adapter adds no geometry of its
 * own.
 *
 * The fill rides on every mark rather than on a group. `render` groups by fill

 * downstream of this reads a group, so grouping here would only be structure

 * React Native reads. That is the same reasoning that keeps `animate.ts` out of static
 * bundles by passing the motion factory in rather than importing it.
 *
 * Kept beside `render` rather than derived from it, or it from this. Both
 * directions were available and both tax the static path everyone is already
 * on: an emitter puts an indirection in it, and making marks primary makes it
 * allocate an array of objects before stringifying. So there are two small
 * traversals of one layout, and the drift that invites is *caught* rather than
 * prevented: `test/marks.test.ts` asserts these serialize to exactly what
 * `render` emits, over the golden corpus, and `packages/harness` compares the
 * React Native adapter against React on every case in its table.
 *
 * No `mo` parameter. React Native never animates (the motion layer is CSS), so
 * there is no motion grouping to emit and no class to carry.
