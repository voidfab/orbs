/**
 * The idle layer, evaluated rather than declared. See `docs/motion-spec.md`.
 *
 * `motion.css` is the original and stays the original: on the web the browser
 * runs these loops off a stylesheet and nothing in TypeScript is involved. This
 * file is the same seven animations written as arithmetic, for React Native,
 * which has no stylesheet, no custom properties and no `@keyframes`.
 *
 * ## The whole idle layer is a pure function of time
 *
 * That is the property everything here rests on, and it is worth stating
 * because it is not obvious from the CSS. Every loop is `infinite`, none of
 * them has a start event, none reacts to anything, and the only inputs are the
 * seeded timings, the amplitude, and two pose channels. So there is no state to
 * keep, nothing to start or stop, and no drift to correct: given a clock,
 * `idleAt` says what the blobatar looks like, and two blobatars that agree
 * about the clock agree about everything.
 *
 * It is also what makes this testable without a device. `scripts/probe-idle.ts`
 * runs the real stylesheet in headless Chrome, freezes it at sampled times, and
 * compares the matrices the browser computed against what this returns. That is
 * the only honest oracle for a port of a stylesheet, and it is the same
 * instrument `probe-compose.ts` already uses for the pose.
 *
 * ## What amplitude means here
 *
 * On the web `--mo-amp` ramps 0 to 1 on hover, and is pinned to 1 by
 * `animate="always"`. There is no hover on a touch screen, and `motion.css`
 * already says so itself: under `@media not ((hover: hover) and (pointer:
 * fine))` every loop is paused and amplitude forced to 0 unless the blobatar is
 * `mo-always`. So the only mode this platform has is the always one, and
 * amplitude is a plain 0-to-1 the caller ramps rather than a hover state.
 *
 * ## What is not here
 *
 * The hover lift, which is `.mo-root:hover`'s `translateY(-1.5px) scale(1.04)`,
 * because it is a pointer response and there is no pointer. `--mo-rate`, the
 * slow-motion debugging dial, because it is a stylesheet class for a person
 * looking at a page. Both are the web's, and neither has a meaning to port.
