/* morphicons core — pure DOM-free functions: they consume icon data and
   produce `d` strings and numbers. Pipeline:
   normalize → resample → match → align → plan → interpolate(t) → d

   This entry exposes the consumer surface (the size budget is measured
   here). Introspection utilities — parsePath, procrustes, alignPair,
   detectCorners, arcLength, KAPPA… — are imported from their modules in
   src/core/ (tests, playground, tooling). */
