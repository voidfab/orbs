// Morph: a dotted outline cycling circle → triangle → square → circle —
// the "shaping" state. Each shape is a continuous closed path
// parameterised by arc length (top-centre start, clockwise). Every
// frame the engine blends the two neighbouring paths, then lays the
// dots EVENLY along the blended outline — spacing stays uniform at
// every instant of the morph, holds and transitions alike.
