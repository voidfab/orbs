// Fault: the field breaks apart and reassembles into a dotted X, then holds —
// the "error" state.
//
// Why a distinct mode rather than a variant of `shatter`: sharing shatter's
// painter made error differ from retrying only in TIMING, so mid-burst they
// were indistinguishable. Tinting it red would have fixed that instantly, but
// this library is deliberately single-hue — the whole depth language is one
// ramp — so the difference has to be structural instead. An X is unambiguous
// without colour and still legible at 20px, and it's in keeping with `morph`
// already trading in literal primitives (circle, triangle, square).
//
// The projection deliberately has NO tilt and its yaw dies out as the X forms:
// a tilted X skews into a lopsided cross, and motion stopping is itself part of
// the error read.
