// Shatter: a sphere bursts outward, hangs scattered, then snaps back — the
// "retrying" state, and with `settle: 0` the "error" state too.
//
// `settle` is what makes one painter serve both:
//   settle 1 — the field reassembles, so it loops as "trying again"
//   settle 0 — it never comes back; pair with `once` and it bursts and holds,
//              which is the terminal error read
// That's why `error` needed a painter rather than a re-tuning: no amount of
// preset twiddling on an existing mode expresses "and then it stays broken".
//
// Dots sit on a Fibonacci lattice rather than the lat/long field the sphere
// modes use — evenly spread reads better once scattered, and it keeps the calm
// phase visually distinct from `searching` and friends.
